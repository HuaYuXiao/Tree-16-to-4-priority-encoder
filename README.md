# Tree-16-to-4-priority-encoder-in-VHDL
SUSTech EE332 Digital System Design 

A priority encoder is a circuit that returns the codes for the highest-priority request. By using a
conditional signal assignment or if statements to naturally describe this function, the shape of the specified priority network is a single cascading chain.

## Prelab exercise:
Refer to the 4-to-2 priority encoder on Page 81, develop a VHDL code to realize a 16-to-4 priority
encoder using a conditional signal assignment. The outputs of the encoder are a 4-bit code and a 1-bit activity flag. Sketch the conceptual implementation of the design.

## During the lab:
To shape the layout of the circuit to a tree form so that to reduce the critical path of the designed 16-to-4 priority encoder.

Develop the block diagram of the design.

Based on the block diagram, develop the VHDL code of the design using component instantiation.

Do the simulation of the design.

Compare the layout and performance of the tree design with that of the cascading design.
